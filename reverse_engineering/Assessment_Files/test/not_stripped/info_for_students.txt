The included binary, ReTestLabs, is a partially stripped binary. You will be asked questions regarding the binary.

The binary is a bad text version of a clicker game. No extra credit will be given for high scores, so don't waste too much time.

Game state is kept in a game struct per game, and a few other structures are used to keep track of things.

Much like real-world RE situations, you will likely not have enough time to fully annotate the binary.  Instead, focus on doing only what you will need to do to answer the questions.

Read through all of the questions FIRST; some of them provide useful information about what the code really does.
