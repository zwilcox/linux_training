This program is an add-on to StructureDemo\ as it has 2 more enums (eyes, hair) and a new Bios structure as a member of the original Student struct.
Good practice for those that want to see a struct within a struct or just more struct building practice.  Highly recommend issuing as extra practice.
In addition to referencing the source code, students can check their offsets and structure size against solcheck.
