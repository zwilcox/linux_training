Question 5
2.5 / 4 pts
Write a simple Python program (no loops) that takes in user input and print out the result based on the following values:
1pt - value '0' == prints 'Exit'
1pt - value '1' == prints the following string: "This Would Take A Really Long Time To Do By Hand So You Should Use Python Instead!"
1pt - value '2' == prints the string from value 1 as a list of words 
1pt - value '3' == prints the reverse of the string from value 1

please provide your code 
Your code will be hand-graded by the instructor.

Your Answer:
value = input()
s = 'This Would Take A Really Long Time To Do By Hand So You Should Use Python Instead!'
if value == '0':
    exit()
elif value == '1':
    print(s)
elif value == '2':
    print(s.split(' '))
elif value == '3':
    print(' '.join(s.split(' ')[::-1])) 
This calls exit as opposed to printing the string "Exit" """ if value == '0': exit() """ This reverses the list from value 2 and prints the reversed list as a string. However, it should reverse the string from value 1 which would have a different result. """ elif value == '3': print(' '.join(s.split(' ')[::-1])) """
