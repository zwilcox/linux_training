This is a quick demo for LD_PRELOAD (slide 63):
Step 1: run make
Step 2: see command sequence below
Step 3: talk through target.c source with the students

[student@localhost ret_patch]$ ./target
Please run this program as root
[student@localhost ret_patch]$ sudo ./target
[sudo] password for student: 
I see the id as 0
I see the id as 0
Nice
[student@localhost ret_patch]$ LD_PRELOAD=./preloadthis.so ./target
I see the id as 1000
No, really, run it as root
