login me
reset
password AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA <- can range from 33-38 bytes (all valid)

The vulnerability exists because the free in reset frees the memory to the heap. Then we
we try and enter a password that is the exact same size as the structure the heap is
choosing to reuse that same block. The data is then initialized to all A's (x34)
