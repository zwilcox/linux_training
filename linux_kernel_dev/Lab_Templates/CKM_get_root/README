File Overview: THIS IS AN OPTIONAL LAB - give if time allotted

bpf-helper.c 
- bpf helper functions for seccomp 
- used by sandboxer.c to install seccomp for your program 
- NO need to edit

hexdump.c
- contains a helper function to print out a hexdump of a given buffer
- use it during debugging to view memory around and make observations about kernel structures etc
- NO need to edit

rooter.c
- EDIT: this is the file you need to fill out!
- first: get your read/write/peek primatives filled out
- second: figure out how to find the cred struct, overwrite creds, disable seccomp and disable selinux

roothelper.c
- this is a vulnerable driver - it's pretty much the most vulnerable one you could find
- allows for arbitrary read/write of any memory and also lets you view current
- leverage this to get your primatives
- NO need to edit

sandboxer.c
- this uses bpf-helper to install seccomp for you rooter program
- in addition to selinux and being run as non-root, the seccomp filter limits the syscalls allowed for rooter
