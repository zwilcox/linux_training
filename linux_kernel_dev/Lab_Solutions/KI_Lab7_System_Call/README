1) Copy the ext folder to the kernel source root directory
2) Add the following line to include/linux/syscalls.h:
	asmlinkage long sys_helloworld(void);
3) Add an entry for the syscall in arch/x86_64/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl
	e.g., 335	common	helloworld	__x64_sys_helloworld
4) Edit the top-level kernel Makefile by adding ext/ to core-y
	e.g.,
		core-y += ext/
