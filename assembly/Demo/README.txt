Instructor Notes:
hello.asm is a simple Intel x86_64 assembly file that uses a syscall to print Hello World. 

use the command: nasm -felf64 hello.asm && ld -o hello hello.o && ./hello - to build and execute hello.asm


 
Goal: shows how to format and build a very basic assembly file as the lab/test suite does everything for you. Knowing how to do this might help with validation/troubleshooting during the exam.
