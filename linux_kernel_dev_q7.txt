Question 3

You are writing a kernel module that, upon loading, will modify a region of memory in an already running process. You can modify the contents of another process's virtual memory addresses using the 
access_process_vm
 function. Passing in 
FOLL_FORCE 
 to the function will cause this to disregard any permissions on that physical memory.
Answer 1:
Correct!access_process_vm
Correct Answer
ptrace_access_vm 
Correct Answer
__access_remote_vm 
Correct Answer
access_remote_vm 
Answer 2:
Correct!FOLL_FORCE

Question 5

You are rooting a kernel on a device for which you have the source code but no binary or compilation script. You decide to compile the kernel yourself with the code, and use the resulting image to give you the offsets for members of the cred struct. This is 
  a good idea, because you can use this to defeat KASLR 
  a good idea, because you can't guess the offsets dynamically 
  a bad idea, because KASLR will change the offets within a struct 
Correct!
  a bad idea, because your compilation may have a different "__randomize_layout" seed
