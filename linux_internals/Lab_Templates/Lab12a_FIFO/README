This lab is OPTIONAL and can be given to classes that are ahead or are looking to practice FIFOs (slide 274)
They should have already created/worked with UNIX Domain Sockets in Systems Programming (slide 275)

FIFO:
1. Create a program that can read from a fifo
2. Create a program that can write to a fifo reading from stdin to get the data
   to send
3. Combine the programs and add a command line option to specify read/write
4. Add a command line argument to specify the name of the fifo. Default a name
   if one is not specified

Notes: There are a reader and writer script that can be used to test each half
of your connection. Use those to get started and test your solutions
