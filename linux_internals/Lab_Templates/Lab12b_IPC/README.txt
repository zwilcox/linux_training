This lab is OPTIONAL and a good play around to get the students ready for the Usermode Crucible. Hand out if time is available on Day 4.

NOTE: When students copy the binary from the share to their local machines, the setuid bit is removed. Have them copy over the folder - then run the .sh script on the 12_ipc binary from their local machine.
