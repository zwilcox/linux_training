What is the problem with the following kthread routine?

static int kthread_start(void* data) {
  struct mydata * d = (struct mydata*)data;
  while (!kthread_should_stop()) {
    // Do tasks
    // ...
    ssleep(1); // sleep for a bit
  }
  
  // exiting!
  printk(KERN_INFO "exiting thread\n");
  kthread_stop(current)
  return -1;
}
 

  kthread_should_stop requires an argument to specify which kernel thread to stop 
  The thread shouldn't return a negative number 
Correct!
  The call to kthread_stop is a problem 
  It is bad to ssleep inside of a kernel thread, because it takes CPU time 
  kthread_should_stop shouldn't be called in a loop, it should only ever be called once per kthread 
  The thread needs to call do_exit, and can't just return
