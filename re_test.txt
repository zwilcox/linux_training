There are two global counters in the source code, we called them:

// tracks running games
int32_t active_games = AG_START_VAL;
// used for unique game ids
int32_t game_id_counter = GID_START_VAL;

The address of the global in the binary most likely to be named game_id_counter is what?

Your answer should be a memory address starting with hex "0x" without leading zeros, such as 0x1234567
